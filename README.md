# Hi I'm Dino ðŸ‘‹
I am a highly tech-savvy professional with extensive experience in the technology sector, specializing in eCommerce, email marketing automation, and both manual and automated SaaS QA product testing.

For over a decade, I have successfully worked as a freelancer through Upwork, where my detailed work history can be reviewed on my profile.

I primarily collaborate directly with SaaS companies, providing cross-departmental support to address any challenges or needs they may encounter.

Over the years, I have honed my skills and expanded my knowledge through a combination of company training and self-directed learning. I have developed expertise in working with a variety of SaaS applications, adapting quickly to new tools and technologies.

Eager to further enhance my capabilities, I recently completed a Full-Stack JavaScript bootcamp, earning the title of Junior Full-Stack JavaScript Developer. This addition to my skill set reflects my dedication to continuous learning and growth.

Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and modern web technologies. After completing an intensive JavaScript bootcamp, Iâ€™m eager to build scalable, clean, and well-tested applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously improving my skills to create impactful solutions.

I firmly believe that staying current with the latest advancements and innovations is essential for success in the fast-evolving tech industry.

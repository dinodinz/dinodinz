# Hi I'm Dino 👋

I’m a full-stack software developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and modern web technologies. After completing an intensive JavaScript bootcamp, I’m eager to build scalable, clean, and well-tested applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and continuously improving my skills to create impactful solutions.

Prior to becoming a full-stack developer, I spent over 10 years as a technical support specialist for various SaaS applications via Upwork, primarily in eCommerce and email automation industry. This experience gave me a deep understanding of user needs, troubleshooting complex systems, and working closely with development teams—skills that now enhance my approach to software development.

I firmly believe that staying current with the latest advancements and innovations is essential for success in the fast-evolving tech industry.
